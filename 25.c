/*Write a program that prompts the user to enter three sets of five double numbers each. The program should accomplish all of the following: (a)
Store the information in a 3x5 array. (b) Compute the average of each set of five values. (c) Compute the average of all the values. (d) Determine the
largest value of the 15 values. (e) Report the results. Each major task should be handled by a separate function using the traditional C approach to
handling arrays. Accomplish task "b" by using a function that computes and returns the average of a one-dimensional array; use a loop to call this
function three times. The other tasks should take the entire array as an argument, and the functions performing tasks "c" and "d" should return the
answer to the calling program.*/
